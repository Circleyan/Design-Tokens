# Design tokens starter set for your design system

If you want to start with a token set for your design system but don't know how to proceed, this set can help.

This set is part of the "Design Tokens Starter Set" and primarily aims at design roles working with Figma. Find the related [free Figma-Library here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1316042479653154791/design-tokens-starter-set-json-variables-tokens-studio-sync) and the JSON file was written with [Tokensstudio](https://tokens.studio/).

With the release of v2.0.0 from Tokens Studio, the token set is now in W3C DTCG format and therefore compatible with tools like Zeroheight or similar.

## Note

As this is intended as a starter set, the repo does not contain any links to style dictionaries, for example.
