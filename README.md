# Design tokens starter set for your design system

If you want to start with a token set for your design system but don't know how to proceed, this set can help.

This set is part of the "Design Tokens Starter Set" an is primarily aimed at design roles that work with Figma. Find the related [free Figma-Library here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1316042479653154791/design-tokens-starter-set-json-variables-tokens-studio-sync) and the JSON file was written with [Tokensstudio](https://tokens.studio/).

This means the format still needs to be adapted in the Zeroheight tokens tool and will differ slightly from the recommended [W3C format] (https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/)t.

## Note

As this is intended as a starter set, the repo does not contain any links to style dictionaries, for example.
