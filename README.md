# Design tokens starter set for your design system

If you want to start with a token set for your design system but don't know exactly how to proceed, this set can help.

This set is primarily aimed at design roles that work with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and the JSON file was written with [Tokensstudio](https://tokens.studio/).

This means that the format still needs to be adapted in the Zeroheight tokens tool, for example.

## Note

As this is intended as a starter set, the repo does not contain any links to style dictionaries, for example.
